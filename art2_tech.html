    <p>
        South Asia is witnessing a sharp increase in extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods,
        cyclones, and erratic rainfall patterns, raising serious concerns about climate resilience in one of
        the world’s most densely populated regions. Climate scientists warn that without urgent adaptation
        and mitigation measures, the frequency and intensity of such events are likely to worsen in the
        coming years.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the past decade, countries across South Asia have experienced record-breaking temperatures,
        devastating floods, and prolonged droughts. These events have not only caused loss of life and
        property but have also disrupted livelihoods, agriculture, and critical infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3>Rising Temperatures and Heatwaves</h3>

         class="section-image">

    <p>
        One of the most visible impacts of climate change in the region is the increase in average
        temperatures. Extended heatwaves have become more frequent, particularly during pre-monsoon months.
        Urban areas are especially vulnerable due to the heat island effect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Health experts have reported a rise in heat-related illnesses, particularly among the elderly,
        outdoor workers, and economically disadvantaged populations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Governments have begun issuing heat action plans, including early warning systems and public
        awareness campaigns, but implementation remains uneven across regions.
    </p>

    <h3>Floods and Changing Rainfall Patterns</h3>

         alt="Flooded Urban Area" 
         class="section-image">

    <p>
        While some areas are experiencing severe droughts, others are facing intense flooding due to
        unpredictable rainfall patterns. Climate scientists attribute this variability to changes in
        monsoon behavior driven by rising global temperatures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Urban flooding has become a recurring problem, with inadequate drainage systems struggling to cope
        with sudden heavy rainfall.
    </p>

    <p>
        Experts emphasize the need for improved water management systems, climate-resilient infrastructure,
        and better land-use planning to reduce flood risks.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact on Agriculture and Food Security</h3>

         alt="Agriculture and Climate Change" 
         class="section-image">

    <p>
        Agriculture, which employs a significant portion of South Asia’s population, is highly sensitive
        to climate variability. Changes in rainfall timing, increased pest infestations, and soil
        degradation are affecting crop productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Small and marginal farmers are particularly vulnerable, as they often lack access to insurance,
        credit, and advanced farming technologies.
    </p>

    <h3>Policy Responses and Regional Cooperation</h3>

    <p>
        Governments across South Asia have acknowledged the urgency of climate action and committed to
        international climate agreements. National climate action plans focus on renewable energy,
        emissions reduction, and adaptation measures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Experts argue that climate change is a transboundary issue requiring regional cooperation, as
        shared river systems and weather patterns connect countries across borders.
    </p>

    <p>
        Civil society organizations have also called for greater public participation in climate
        decision-making.
    </p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

    <p>
        As climate change continues to reshape South Asia’s environmental landscape, the region faces a
        critical choice between reactive responses and proactive planning. Investing in climate resilience,
        sustainable development, and regional collaboration could help safeguard future generations.
